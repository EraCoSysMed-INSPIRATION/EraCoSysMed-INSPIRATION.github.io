# Welcome to the INSPIRATION Project!

## Qualified Open Systems Pharmacology Modeling Network of Drug-Drug-Gene-Interactions 

This project is part of ERACoSysMed and has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 643271. It is one project of the ERACoSysMed [3rd Joint Transnational Call for European Research Projects on Systems Medicine 2019](https://www.eracosysmed.eu/calls/jtc-3-2019), focusing on research that utilizes computational models to improve knowledge about diseases and adequate treatment.

The aim of INSPIRATION is to improve the outcomes of drug therapy by establishing clinically applicable DDGI models that can be used to guide drug treatment. 

- Unique 
- Publicly available 
- Benefits for patients, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical industry 
- Reducing costs of health-care system 

INSPIRATION is conducted by highly experienced [partners from clinics, academia, and pharmaceutical industry](https://eracosysmed-inspiration.github.io/partners/).
