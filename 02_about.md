### \- A new level of qualified Drug-Drug-Gene-Interaction (DDGI) network models -  

The aim of INSPIRATION is to establish clinically applicable DDGI models that can be used by physicians to guide drug treatment in the case of DDGI. 

The qualified models will be made publicly available on the GitHub website of the [Open Systems Pharmacology (OSP) community](http://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/), together with a newly established DDGI database to provide the clinical data used for model development. 

The specific scientific and technological objectives of INSPIRATION are: 

1. to extend and qualify whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) DDGI models within a network structure using literature and real-world patient data from the TDM (therapeutic drug monitoring) database from Leiden University 

2. to develop a qualification method for DDGI networks 

3. to build a publicly accessible database for DDGI data 

4. to develop a technique to estimate population and interindividual variability with PBPK models 

5. to develop a clinical decision support system for physicians and patients to assess DDGI and to provide individual dosing recommendations
